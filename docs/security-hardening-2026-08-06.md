# Security hardening (2026-08-06)

This document records the controls added after reviewing the repository security advisories with
`gh api /repos/kyndform/kyndform/security-advisories`. It is intended as a deployment and regression
checklist; it does not replace the individual GitHub advisory descriptions.

## Advisories addressed by this hardening pass

| Advisory              | Control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GHSA-896g-r3w9-8wwc` | Ignore respondent-supplied payment amount and currency. Recalculate cents and currency from the published payment field and server-evaluated variables before storing the answer or creating a Stripe PaymentIntent.                     |
| `GHSA-gr8g-m552-m98h` | Apply HTTP and atomic Redis user/team hourly limits to every AI mutation.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `GHSA-hr8q-22g4-x4m3` | Escape email template replacements and answer/hidden-field HTML; allow only a small trusted submission markup fragment.                                                                                                                  |
| `GHSA-w3w4-6w6m-mj29` | Use Express `req.ip` rather than reading `X-Forwarded-For` directly, default `trust proxy` to disabled, and require an explicit topology-specific proxy policy.                                                                          |
| `GHSA-h6wm-rqgg-jc79` | Treat reCAPTCHA as successful only when verification returns the boolean value `true`.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `GHSA-j57w-pm93-6fvc` | Prefix formula-like CSV cells, including values with leading whitespace, across labels, answers, and hidden fields.                                                                                                                      |
| `GHSA-gw5m-8m96-xh35` | Restrict project-member changes to workspace owners/admins or the project owner, require workspace membership, and protect owners from removal.                                                                                          |
| `GHSA-gmv5-7252-rqxr` | Resolve template clones only through the published-template collection.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `GHSA-vvjj-j3hw-88fq` | Reject CSS rule-breakout characters server-side and sanitize theme values again in the renderer. URL background images are emitted as escaped CSS strings.                                                                               |
| `GHSA-pxw5-pjrc-j758` | Stage uploads in bounded memory, authorize the upload context before persistence, require an allowed extension/MIME/signature combination, generate storage names, and serve non-images as attachments with `nosniff` and a sandbox CSP. |

The same review also tightened adjacent attack surfaces: upload quotas, remote-image byte/pixel/page
limits and raster re-encoding, webhook time/response limits, literal bounded searches, atomic
single-use verification codes, login/reset throttling and enumeration resistance, form open/time
limit enforcement, server-derived partial submissions, and declared-hidden-field normalization.

## Follow-up advisories addressed (2026-08-07)

| Advisory              | Control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GHSA-j96p-939m-w769` | Atomically reserve each credential/code attempt in Redis before performing the check, so a concurrent burst cannot exceed the configured attempt cap.                                                                                                              |
| `GHSA-mxph-c7p9-c4q4` | Consume verification codes atomically with Redis `HGETDEL`, making successful reset, email, and destructive-action codes single use.                                                                                                                               |
| `GHSA-3rc6-92q4-wm54` | Cap and deduplicate invitation recipients, add request throttling, apply weighted per-user and per-team hourly recipient quotas, and await mail enqueueing.                                                                                                        |
| `GHSA-mg97-68f8-7g35` | Correctly distinguish HTTP from GraphQL in the global exception filter so rejected uploads always receive a bounded HTTP error response.                                                                                                                           |
| `GHSA-m236-4vqc-5wvm` | Cap image resize dimensions and remote-image bytes, pixels, and pages before raster re-encoding.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `GHSA-wfh3-r7x7-q4x4` | Disable renderer autosave by default and in the hosted web app, purge the legacy localStorage bucket, and use opt-in sessionStorage with a one-hour expiry for consumers that explicitly enable it.                                                                |
| `GHSA-35mg-x82v-23mc` | Return generic messages for unexpected GraphQL and REST exceptions while preserving deliberate client-facing HTTP errors and server-side logging.                                                                                                                  |
| `GHSA-2crf-q7gp-c38w` | Serialize the authoritative MongoDB quota count and submission insert with a distributed per-form Redis lock, preventing concurrent submissions from exceeding the configured cap without introducing a drifting shadow count.                                     |
| `GHSA-h5hf-28ww-qpcp` | Hash form passwords with bcrypt, lazily migrate legacy plaintext values after successful verification, bind short-lived password tokens to the form/respondent/current hash, hide hashes from GraphQL, and disable/redact Mongo query logging outside development. |
| `GHSA-mv7c-xj63-2mj9` | Allowlist, cap, normalize, and deduplicate languages; queue only newly added translations; apply weighted per-user and per-team hourly quotas; and use retry-safe deterministic queue job IDs.                                                                     |
| `GHSA-6frh-3cxm-9qcj` | Make special-field validators fail closed, validate production submissions before the packaged parser runs, guard table parsing, and skip malformed historical answers instead of aborting an entire export.                                                       |
| `GHSA-p5gh-7839-pj2g` | Accept signature URLs only from the configured application and S3 origins, retain legacy PNG data URIs, and proxy dashboard signature rendering so historical attacker-controlled URLs are never fetched by an owner's browser.                                    |
| `GHSA-3h48-xfjq-92rr` | Resolve edited answers from the server-owned form schema, validate values through the production submission validators, ignore caller-supplied kinds/properties, and render historical unsafe URL schemes as inert text.                                           |

## Additional advisories addressed (2026-08-10)

| Advisory              | Control                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GHSA-wj7j-xr73-3jvj` | Disable and trash every form in a project before deleting its submissions, forms, memberships, and project record. Active forms are included in the cascade.                                      |
| `GHSA-mj5v-4j4p-2738` | Disable and purge all forms before workspace or account deletion removes the parent workspace, its memberships, social accounts, or user record.                                                  |
| `GHSA-6j6r-v2pj-m6q6` | Require the current password before changing an email address and invalidate all existing sessions after the change succeeds. The dashboard now performs the same step-up authentication.         |
| `GHSA-8h75-jqmj-4rm4` | Restrict Stripe authorization, connection, and revocation to workspace owners. Revocation uses an explicit MongoDB `$unset` so the destination is actually removed.                               |
| `GHSA-wq59-xjvr-vw2x` | Return Stripe PaymentIntent `client_secret` only in the submitter's transient response, never persist it in an answer, and remove legacy values when a payment-success webhook updates an answer. |
| `GHSA-rvjc-v3gr-6w5g` | Accept payment receipt links only from credential-free, default-port HTTPS URLs on `stripe.com` or its subdomains; historical unsafe receipt links render as inert content.                       |
| `GHSA-93g9-7q2h-r4qc` | Accept file-upload answers only from the configured application/S3 upload origins, including supported legacy reference shapes; historical external file links are not rendered as attachments.   |
| `GHSA-3h48-xfjq-92rr` | Rechecked the server-derived edited-answer kind and metadata, production validation, special-field checks, and inert rendering of historical unsafe URL answers.                                  |
| `GHSA-p5gh-7839-pj2g` | Rechecked trusted-origin signature validation and dashboard image proxying.                                                                                                                       |
| `GHSA-3p74-9f2j-phr9` | Route account, workspace, and project deletion-code emails through the existing resend cooldown and daily verification-code cap.                                                                  |

## Previously landed advisory controls rechecked

The current branch already contains controls for the earlier published advisories:

- DNS-pinned outbound requests, private/reserved address rejection, disabled redirects, and URL
  revalidation cover the image/webhook SSRF and DNS-rebinding reports (`GHSA-xff7-g8xv-7624`,
  `GHSA-3j2g-3q97-fvv5`, and `GHSA-wqm9-jpx4-fw74`).
- Rich-text schema allowlisting and unsafe URL-protocol filtering cover stored form-content XSS
  (`GHSA-8q89-27mx-fvg6` and `GHSA-chmm-jqpm-3pwx`).
- Style-tag-safe rendering and custom CSS HTML-breakout rejection cover
  `GHSA-8fm3-p5vh-vrqm`.
- Declared hidden-field normalization covers `GHSA-r7vg-xh87-v4w3`.
- Context-bound upload authorization covers `GHSA-432x-54v2-p7p7`; SVG is not an accepted upload
  type, covering `GHSA-m94h-jxvc-hhch`.
- Explicit credentialed-CORS origin allowlisting covers `GHSA-fg7j-rmgr-rc9g`.
- One-time OAuth state validation and JavaScript-safe callback JSON cover
  `GHSA-2pg5-q4m8-mc92` and the Stripe/social callback XSS variants.
- Password changes and password resets invalidate all server-side sessions, covering
  `GHSA-qq3g-9rvp-7wj3`.

## Deployment requirements

1. Run production containers with `NODE_ENV=production`. The Docker runner now sets this value.
2. Keep `KYNDFORM_ALLOW_PRIVATE_OUTBOUND=false` (or unset) in production. Private/localhost
   outbound access is permitted only when both `NODE_ENV=development` and this flag is exactly
   `true`.
3. `TRUST_PROXY` defaults to `false`. If a known reverse proxy is the only network path to the
   application, set the exact Express trust-proxy value for that topology (for example `1` for
   exactly one enforced hop). Do not enable it while the application port remains directly
   reachable from untrusted clients.
4. Configure `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with exact dashboard origins; never use a wildcard with
   credentialed requests.
5. Keep Redis available. Distributed upload, AI/translation, invitation, authentication,
   verification-code, and submission-quota controls depend on atomic Redis operations.
6. Existing S3 objects retain the metadata and ACL they were uploaded with. Rewrite their
   `Content-Type`/`Content-Disposition` metadata or delete untrusted historical objects as part of
   deployment. New objects receive generated keys and safe response metadata, but remain
   `public-read` for compatibility with existing public form URLs.
7. If stronger file confidentiality is required, move uploads to a private bucket and add an
   authenticated/signed download path before removing the compatibility ACL.
8. Before deploying the 2026-08-10 deletion fixes, back up the database and identify forms whose
   `projectId` or `teamId` no longer resolves. Disable them immediately, then remove the orphaned
   forms, submissions, memberships, and integrations according to the organization's retention
   policy. The application fix prevents new orphan creation but cannot infer the intended
   retention policy for records orphaned by an older version.
9. Remove historical `answers[].value.clientSecret` properties from stored submissions after a
   verified backup. New submissions never persist this value, and payment-success webhooks remove
   it while updating legacy answers, but completed historical records may otherwise retain it.
10. Set `S3_PUBLIC_URL` to the exact public upload origin when S3-compatible storage is used. The
    submission API and dashboard now reject file/signature URLs outside the application and
    configured upload origins.

## Regression checks

Run these checks before release:

```sh
pnpm --filter ./packages/server type-check
pnpm --filter ./packages/server build
pnpm lint
```

The focused tests in `packages/server/test` cover payment integrity, authorization, auth abuse,
form submission integrity, CSV/email injection, upload/image validation, outbound URL pinning,
AI quotas, Redis atomicity, webhook limits, and theme CSS validation. The form-renderer theme test
and answer-utils HTML escaping test cover their respective package boundaries.
