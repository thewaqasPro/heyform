# Server E2E Tests

End-to-end tests for the KyndForm NestJS server. They drive a running instance
over HTTP/GraphQL using the **same surface** the webapp talks to
(`X-Device-Id` header + cookie session + Apollo-style JSON POSTs to
`/graphql`).

> The suite requires a running server backed by **MongoDB** and **Redis/KeyDB**.
> These are not unit tests — they exercise real infrastructure.

## Running

### Option A — against an already-running server

```bash
# Bring the stack up
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Then run the suite (from repo root)
pnpm --filter ./packages/server run test:e2e
```

The runner targets `http://localhost:9157` (the port published by
`docker-compose.test.yml`). Override with `E2E_BASE_URL`.

### Option B — bring the stack up and tear it down around the run

```bash
pnpm --filter ./packages/server run test:e2e:docker
```

This calls `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --build kyndform`,
waits for `/health/ready`, runs the tests, then `docker compose down -v`.
Pass `E2E_KEEP_UP=1` to keep the stack running afterwards.

### Option C — CI (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/server-e2e.yml` runs the suite on push/PR touching
`packages/server` or its workspace deps. Server logs are uploaded on failure.

Before the first run, populate `.env` in the repo root:

```env
SESSION_KEY=<32-char random>
FORM_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-char random>
APP_HOMEPAGE_URL=http://localhost:9157
```

## Environment variables

| Variable           | Default                                | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `E2E_BASE_URL`     | `http://localhost:9157`                | Target server.                                           |
| `E2E_SKIP_WAIT`    | _unset_                                | Skip the `/health/ready` probe before running suites.    |
| `E2E_WAIT_MS`      | `60000`                                | Max wait for readiness.                                  |
| `E2E_ONLY`         | _unset_                                | Comma-separated suite names to run (e.g. `team,matrix`). |
| `E2E_KEEP_UP`      | _unset_                                | `1` leaves the docker stack running (docker mode only).  |
| `E2E_MONGO_URI`    | `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/kyndform`    | Direct-mongo seed for `helpers/seed.ts`.                 |
| `E2E_REDIS_HOST`   | `127.0.0.1`                            | Used by `helpers/verification.ts`.                       |
| `E2E_REDIS_PORT`   | `9514`                                 | KeyDB port exposed by `docker-compose.test.yml`.         |

`docker-compose.test.yml` publishes mongo on `27017:27017` and keydb on
`9514:6379` so the helpers can reach them from the host.

## Suite-by-suite breakdown (run order)

| Order | Suite                | Approx. cases | What it covers                                                                                       |
| ----- | -------------------- | -------------:| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `health`             | 2             | `/health`, `/health/ready` reports mongo + redis up.                                                 |
| 2     | `auth`               | 9             | DeviceId guard, sign-up (cookies, `userDetail`), duplicate-email, weak password, login Query, wrong password, missing account, unauthenticated `userDetail`, `/logout`. |
| 3     | `catalog`            | 3             | `apps` (public), `templates` (auth-only), unauthenticated `templates` rejected.                      |
| 4     | `input validation`   | 16            | Empty/oversize names, malformed emails, missing required fields, invalid enum values, weak password. |
| 5     | `auth flows`         | 7             | `updateUserPassword` rotation + wrong-currentPassword + weak-newPassword, `sendResetPasswordEmail`+`resetPassword` end-to-end (code read from Redis), session retained after `removeTeamMember` but team scope lost. |
| 6     | `stateful edges`     | 13            | Stale-version rejection on `updateFormSchemas`/`publishForm`, idempotent double-trash, `restoreForm` on NORMAL form is a no-op, **`deleteForm` returns true even on NORMAL form (server bug)**, cross-team `formDetail`/`forms` leakage forbidden, `joinTeam` failures (wrong code / already joined / rotated code), `leaveTeam` blocks the owner, `removeTeamMember` refuses the owner, `transferTeam` to non-member rejected, `openForm` on unpublished form, `completeSubmission` with bad `openToken`. |
| 7     | `team flow`          | 15            | Stateful admin → COLLABORATOR (joins by invite) → MEMBER (seeded) → workspace → project → form → publish → submit → archive → delete form → delete project → dissolve team. Cookies reused; no re-auth. |
| 8     | `permission matrix`  | 205           | Programmatic table: each GraphQL op × six callers (admin/collaborator/member/teamOnly/outsider/anonymous). Asserts pass/fail against actual resolver behaviour. ~34 operations covered. |
| 9     | `rate limit`         | 3             | Login locks the user out after 5 wrong passwords (15-min window); `sendResetPasswordEmail` 60s per-user cooldown. Runs **last** because it burns per-user attempt counters. |

**Total: ~276 cases, completes in ≈ 6s** against a warm dockerised stack.

### Caller identities in `permission matrix`

| Caller         | In team?     | Team role        | In project?  |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |
| `admin`        | yes          | `ADMIN`          | yes (owner)  |
| `collaborator` | yes (joined) | `COLLABORATOR`   | yes (added)  |
| `member`       | yes (seeded) | `MEMBER`         | yes (added)  |
| `teamOnly`     | yes (seeded) | `COLLABORATOR`   | **no**       |
| `outsider`     | no           | _n/a_            | no           |
| `anonymous`    | no session   | _n/a_            | no           |

#### Ops probed by the matrix

- **Public** (anyone, no session needed): `apps`, `publicForm`, `publicTeamDetail`, `openForm`.
- **Auth-only** (any signed-in user, no team context): `userDetail`, `updateUser`, `teams`, `templates`.
- **Team-scoped reads** (any team member, no role check): `teamMembers`, `teamOverview`, `teamRecentForms`, `searchTeam`, `createBrandKit`.
- **Project/form-scoped** (any project member; `teamOnly` explicitly fails because it's in the team but not the project): `forms`, `formDetail`, `formAnalytic`, `formIntegrations`, `formReport`, `updateForm`, `renameProject`, `updateFormLogics`, `updateFormVariables`, `updateFormHiddenFields`, `updateFormArchive`, `updateFormTheme`, `duplicateForm`, `submissions`.
- **Owner-only** (admin only; every other authenticated caller errors): `updateTeam`, `inviteMember`, `dissolveTeamCode`, `deleteProjectCode`, `resetTeamInviteCode`.
- **Documented-bug probes** (locked at `error` for every caller):
  - `searchForms` — resolver has `@TeamGuard()` but `SearchFormInput` has no `teamId` field; the guard rejects unconditionally. Drop the row once the decorator is removed.
  - `templateDetail` — server returns `{}`, but `TemplateType.id` is non-nullable so GraphQL errors before the schema is exercised. Drop the row once the resolver is implemented.

### Server bugs locked by the test suite

These are not test bugs — the suite intentionally documents the live behaviour:

- **`deleteForm` returns `true` even when nothing was deleted.** `formService.delete` only removes rows with `status: TRASH`, but the resolver always returns `true`. Locked by `stateful-edges` "deleteForm against a NORMAL form leaves it in place but server still returns true".
- **`searchForms` is broken.** `@TeamGuard()` on a resolver whose input lacks `teamId`. Locked by `permission-matrix` `searchForms — * (error)`.
- **`templateDetail` is a stub.** Returns `{}` and the GraphQL non-nullability check fires. Locked by `permission-matrix` `templateDetail — * (error)`.
- **`updateTeamMemberRole`** exists in the webapp gql but has **no server resolver**. Not probed at all (would always 404 the operation).

### Webapp ops intentionally out of scope

- **External-service-dependent**: `createFormWithAI`, `createFieldsWithAI`,
  `createFormLogicsWithAI`, `createFormThemeWithAI` (OpenAI), `stripeAuthorizeUrl`,
  `connectStripe`, `revokeStripeAccount` (Stripe), `importForm` (external URL),
  `addCustomDomain` (DNS), `exportTeamData` (S3).
- **Phantom resolvers** (webapp calls, no server handler): `updateTeamMemberRole`,
  `emptyTrash`, `submissionLocations`, `createFormField`/`updateFormField`/`deleteFormField`,
  `createFormCustomReport`/`updateFormCustomReport`, `updateFormIntegration` (singular).
- **Destructive ops with delicate setup**: `transferTeam` (changes ownership; covered
  for "non-member target" only in stateful-edges), `leaveTeam` (covered for the
  owner-blocked path), `removeTeamMember` (covered in auth-flows).

## Test design notes

- **Session reuse.** Each role keeps its own `E2EClient` (one cookie jar)
  across all tests in its suite. team-flow and permission-matrix sign up users
  exactly once and never re-authenticate.
- **No global cleanup.** Re-using the same mongo DB across runs accumulates
  test data. Nuke the volume between big runs:
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v`.
- **Order matters globally.** `rate-limit` is registered last because it
  deliberately burns per-user lockout counters. Within `permission matrix`,
  probe order is: read-only → idempotent writes → ops that mutate shared state
  (e.g. `resetTeamInviteCode` rotates `inviteCode`; it's parked last).
- **Direct DB seeding for MEMBER role.** No server mutation assigns
  `TeamRoleEnum.MEMBER`. `helpers/seed.ts` upserts directly into
  `teammembermodels` (and `projectmembermodels` for project membership). This
  is the only piece of the suite that bypasses the public API.
- **`signUpUser`** in `helpers/fixtures.ts` returns `{ client, id, name,
  email, password }` so suites can use either the cookie-authenticated client
  or the user id (for permission probes / seed targets).

## How the harness works

- **`E2EClient`** wraps native `fetch`. It maintains a tiny cookie jar
  (`KYNDFORM_SESSION`, `KYNDFORM_LOGGED_IN`, `KYNDFORM_DEVICE_ID`) and attaches
  the same `X-Device-Id` + `x-anonymous-id` headers the webapp's Apollo client
  sends — these are what `DeviceIdGuard` and `EndpointAnonymousIdGuard` look
  for.
- **`gql`** posts an Apollo-style JSON body to `/graphql` and returns
  `{ status, data, errors, raw, headers }`. **`gqlOk`** unwraps that, throws
  with a full error payload on failure, and returns `data` on success.
- **Runner** is plain — `defineSuite('name')` returns a `test(name, fn)`
  helper. No Jest, no Mocha. Tests run **sequentially** in registration order
  so closure-based test state (e.g. the matrix `ctx` populated by the setup
  test) is safe.

## Adding new tests

1. **For one-off integration scenarios**: drop a new `*.e2e.test.ts` next to
   its peers, export `build(baseUrl)`, register it inside `run.ts`. Mirror the
   webapp operation in `helpers/gql.ts` if it isn't already there.
2. **For permission boundaries**: add a `MatrixSpec` to `SPECS` in
   `permission-matrix.e2e.test.ts`. Each spec is one operation; the matrix
   handles iterating callers. The `ok(...)` DSL:
   - `ok({ all: 'ok' })` — everyone passes (truly public).
   - `ok({ all: 'ok', anonymous: 'error' })` — auth required, no team context.
   - `ok({ admin: 'ok', otherwise: 'error' })` — owner-only.
   - `ok({ all: 'error' })` — locks a known-broken op until the server is
     fixed.
3. **For validation/edge tests**: pick the closest suite
   (`input-validation`, `stateful-edges`, `auth-flows`) and add a `test(...)`.
4. **For rate-limit/throttling**: add to `rate-limit.e2e.test.ts`; keep it
   last in `run.ts`.

Re-run `pnpm test:e2e` to confirm.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Server at … did not become ready`** — confirm mongo + redis are up and
  the server picked up `SESSION_KEY` and `FORM_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. The readiness
  probe won't flip to `ok` until both checks pass.
- **`Forbidden request error` on GraphQL** — missing `X-Device-Id` /
  `x-anonymous-id`. The harness always sends these; if you see it, something
  is bypassing `E2EClient`.
- **`Limit exceeded. Please try again later.`** — the `rate-limit` suite ran
  before something else expected a clean slate. Flush redis
  (`docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml exec keydb keydb-cli FLUSHDB`).
- **`No verification code found for verify_…`** — the e2e tests read Redis on
  port `9514` (default keydb mapping). If your KeyDB is elsewhere, export
  `E2E_REDIS_PORT` / `E2E_REDIS_HOST`.
